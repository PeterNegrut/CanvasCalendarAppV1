 <i>Snowpiercer</i>&nbsp\;takes places in 2014 after a failed attempt at ge
 oengineering. As a warning\, the film is violent in places. The film raise
 s many questions such as "Should humanity attempt to engineer its way out 
 of the climate crisis?" "Can resource scarcities be managed without resort
 ing to violence?" "What are the limitations of binary or linear problem-so
 lving?"&nbsp\;</p>\n<p class="p1">In order to watch the film critically\, 
 you might apply<span>&nbsp\;</span><a class="external" href="https://sound
 writing.pugetsound.edu/universal/reading-types-critical.html" target="_bla
 nk"><span><span class="s1">critical reading tips from&nbsp\;<em>Sound Writ
 ing</em></span></span><span class="external_link_icon" role="presentation"
 ><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span><
 /a>\, such as by identifying how the film responds to the questions it pos
 es (i.e. noting how the film "builds an argument")\; connecting the film's
  message\, argument\, themes\, etc. to the Tory Stephens article\, to the 
 climate fiction story you read\, and to content you've learned in class or
  in your other classes\; raising new questions that the film has inspired\
 , contextualizing the film and its content/argument\; and allowing yoursel
 f to develop feelings and opinions about the film.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p class="p
 1"><strong>Step Four: Response: Put Snowpiercer into Conversation with the
  Story You Read</strong></p>\n<p class="p1">Tory Stephens argues that "we 
 need more art that encourages us to dream of the future we want and deserv
 e. We need to imagine worlds that have upended the status quo of coloniali
 sm\, extraction\, and oppression." And yet\, it's very hard to find fictio
 nal movies about the climate crisis that envision a future that is anythin
 g but violent\, dystopian\, and even apocalyptic. The climate is typically
  portrayed as&nbsp\;<span>something that characters must survive but canno
 t influence. In a response of either 3-5 minute podcast or 300-400 words\,
  compare the "imagined world" of Snowpiercer to the the short story you re
 ad for today. In your response\, state the title and author of the story y
 ou read\, and consider AT LEAST two of the following guiding questions.</s
 pan></p>\n<ol start="1" type="1">\n<li><span>What kind of world does Snowp
 iercer imagine? How is that future world different from or similar to the 
 world imagined in the short story?</span></li>\n<li>\n<span>What is the me
 ssage that&nbsp\;</span>viewers of Snowpiercer take away from the film? If
  you think of the film as a call to action to its audience\, what response
  is it asking of us? What about the short story's message and call to acti
 on?</li>\n<li>One of the goals of this course is to examine different ways
  to communicate in order to getting people to act on the climate crisis. B
 etween the film and the story that you read\, which one do you think is mo
 re effective at inspiring action? Why?&nbsp\;</li>\n<li>What is one new qu
 estion that emerges for you after having engaged with this week's material
 s?</li>\n<li>What is one thing that you like and one thing you dislike fro
 m each of the pieces?</li>\n</ol><script src="https://instructure-uploads.

 also be a space to reflect more broadly about the role of technology in th
